## Other work that is different from DeepSeek's technical route but is equally "Aha":
1. With only 817 training samples, it achieves outstanding performance on the AIME and MATH benchmarks. Belief: After the model has accumulated rich knowledge during the pre-training phase, it may only need a small number of well-structured samples to unlock advanced reasoning capabilities. https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMO
